## Overview

Definite Protocol is a sophisticated delta-neutral hedging system on Starknet that enables users to earn yield on STRK tokens while maintaining protection against price volatility. Users deposit STRK and receive hSTRK (hedged STRK) tokens, while the protocol automatically manages delta-neutral positions through perpetual futures and options strategies.

### Key Features

- **Delta-Neutral Exposure**: Earn yield without directional price risk
- **Automated Hedging**: Perpetual futures and options strategies managed automatically
- **Real-Time Risk Management**: Autonomous risk scoring with circuit breakers
- **Multi-Source Price Feeds**: Pragma Network integration with DEX fallbacks
- **Keeper-Based Rebalancing**: Automated delta-neutral maintenance
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Comprehensive access controls and emergency mechanisms

## How It Works

### 1. User Deposits STRK

Users deposit STRK tokens into the Protocol Vault and receive hSTRK tokens in return at the current exchange rate.

```
User → [Deposit 100 STRK] → Protocol Vault → [Mint 100 hSTRK] → User
```

### 2. Protocol Hedges Exposure

The protocol automatically opens hedging positions to maintain delta-neutral exposure:

- **Perpetual Futures**: Short STRK perpetuals to hedge spot exposure
- **Options Strategy**: Sell protective puts to capture volatility premium
- **Rebalancing**: Automated keeper system maintains delta-neutral state

### 3. Yield Generation

The protocol generates yield through multiple sources:

- **Funding Rate Arbitrage**: Collect funding rates from perpetual positions
- **Volatility Premium**: Capture premium from systematic put selling
- **Basis Trading**: Exploit spot-futures basis differentials

### 4. Risk Management

Continuous risk monitoring and automated responses:

- **Risk Scoring**: Real-time calculation of protocol risk (0-100)
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic pause on high-risk conditions
- **Position Monitoring**: Health checks and liquidation protection
- **Emergency Controls**: Multi-level emergency response system

### 5. User Withdraws

Users can withdraw at any time by burning hSTRK tokens:

```
User → [Burn 50 hSTRK] → Protocol Vault → [Return 50.5 STRK] → User
                                          (includes accrued yield)
```

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Definite Protocol came from observing a critical gap in the DeFi ecosystem: users who want to earn yield on their crypto assets are forced to accept directional price risk. Traditional staking and yield farming strategies expose users to the full volatility of the underlying asset, which can wipe out gains during market downturns.

We were particularly inspired by:

1. **Traditional Finance Delta-Neutral Strategies**: Hedge funds have used delta-neutral strategies for decades to generate consistent returns regardless of market direction. We wanted to bring this sophisticated approach to DeFi.

2. **The Need for Stable Yields**: During the 2022 crypto bear market, we witnessed countless users lose their staking rewards and more due to asset price depreciation. A delta-neutral approach would have protected them.

3. **Starknet's Technical Capabilities**: The launch of Cairo 2.0 and Starknet's improved performance made it possible to implement complex financial strategies on-chain with reasonable gas costs.

4. **The STRK Token Opportunity**: With STRK being a relatively new token with active perpetual markets and options trading, we saw the perfect opportunity to build a delta-neutral protocol specifically for the Starknet ecosystem.

The vision was clear: create a protocol where users can deposit STRK tokens and earn yield through funding rate arbitrage and volatility premium capture, while the protocol automatically maintains a delta-neutral position to eliminate price risk.

---

## What It Does

Definite Protocol is a fully automated delta-neutral yield generation system for STRK tokens. Here's exactly what it does:

### For Users

**Deposit & Earn**:
- Users deposit STRK tokens into the Protocol Vault
- Receive hSTRK (hedged STRK) tokens representing their position
- Earn yield from multiple sources without exposure to STRK price movements
- Withdraw anytime by burning hSTRK tokens to receive STRK plus accrued yield

**Yield Sources**:
1. **Funding Rate Arbitrage** (5-15% APY): The protocol collects funding rates from short perpetual positions every 8 hours
2. **Volatility Premium Capture** (3-8% APY): Systematic put selling captures option premiums when implied volatility is high
3. **Basis Trading**: Exploits price differences between spot and futures markets

**Expected Total APY**: 8-23% (variable based on market conditions)

### Under the Hood

**Automated Hedging System**:
- When users deposit 100 STRK, the protocol immediately opens short perpetual positions to hedge the exposure
- Options strategies are deployed when implied volatility exceeds thresholds (>60% IV)
- Delta exposure is continuously monitored and rebalanced every 5 minutes
- Target delta: 0 (completely neutral to STRK price movements)

**Risk Management**:
- Real-time risk scoring (0-100 scale) based on leverage, liquidity, drawdown, correlation, and volatility
- Automated circuit breakers pause operations when risk exceeds safe thresholds
- Position health monitoring prevents liquidations
- Emergency mechanisms allow for safe protocol shutdown if needed

**Multi-Source Price Feeds**:
- Primary: Pragma Network oracle for institutional-grade price data
- Fallback: DEX TWAP from Ekubo, MySwap, and JediSwap
- Price validation and staleness checks prevent manipulation
- Confidence scoring ensures data reliability

**Keeper-Based Rebalancing**:
- Automated keepers check delta exposure every 5 minutes
- Rebalancing executes when delta deviation exceeds 10% threshold
- Batch operations optimize gas costs
- Slippage protection on all trades

### Technical Implementation

**7 Production Smart Contracts**:
1. **hSTRK Token**: ERC20 yield-bearing token with pause mechanism
2. **Protocol Vault**: Main contract handling deposits, withdrawals, and fee management
3. **Price Oracle**: Multi-source price feeds with validation
4. **Risk Manager**: Autonomous risk scoring and circuit breakers
5. **Perpetual Hedge**: Short perpetual position management
6. **Options Strategy**: Systematic put selling for premium capture
7. **Rebalancing Engine**: Automated delta-neutral maintenance

**Frontend Application**:
- React-based web interface with StarknetKit wallet integration
- Real-time dashboard showing protocol metrics, TVL, and yields
- Intuitive deposit/withdraw interface
- Position tracking and analytics
- Yield performance charts

**CLI Tool**:
- Rust-based command-line interface for power users

## How We Built It

### Phase 1: Architecture & Planning (Week 1)

**Migration from Algorand**:
- The protocol was originally conceived for Algorand but we decided to migrate to Starknet for better DeFi infrastructure
- Analyzed existing Algorand contracts (hALGO protocol, price oracles, risk managers)
- Removed all Algorand-specific code (PyTeal implementations)
- Designed new architecture optimized for Starknet's account abstraction and Cairo

**Technical Stack Selection**:
- **Cairo 2.11.4**: Latest stable version with improved developer experience

## Challenges We Ran Into

### 1. Cairo Type System Limitations

**Challenge**: Cairo doesn't have a native signed 256-bit integer type (i256), which is essential for delta calculations in hedging strategies.

**Impact**: Delta exposure can be positive or negative, and we needed to track this precisely for rebalancing decisions.

**Solution**:
- Implemented custom signed integer pattern using u256 + boolean sign flag
- Created helper functions for arithmetic operations
- Maintained precision while working within Cairo's constraints

**Learning**: Sometimes you need to build your own primitives when the language doesn't provide them.

### 2. OpenZeppelin Component Integration

**Challenge**: OpenZeppelin 2.0.0 introduced breaking changes in component architecture that conflicted with our contract design.

**Impact**: Initial hSTRK token implementation failed to compile due to component trait conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Simplified hSTRK token to use manual owner management
- Implemented ERC20 functionality directly without components
- Maintained security while avoiding component complexity

**Learning**: Don't over-engineer - sometimes a simpler approach is more maintainable.

### 3. Circular Dependency Resolution

**Challenge**: Protocol Vault needs hSTRK token address for minting, but hSTRK token needs Vault address for access control.

**Impact**: Impossible to deploy both contracts simultaneously.

**Solution**:
- Deploy hSTRK with temporary vault address (deployer address)
- Deploy Protocol Vault with hSTRK address
- Call `set_protocol_vault()` on hSTRK to update to correct address
- Document this process clearly for future deployments

**Learning**: Circular dependencies require creative deployment strategies.

### 4. Storage API Migration

**Challenge**: Cairo deprecated LegacyMap in favor of new Map type, requiring different trait imports.

**Impact**: All storage operations failed with "trait not found" errors.

**Solution**:
- Updated all storage declarations from LegacyMap to Map
- Added proper trait imports: StoragePointerReadAccess, StoragePointerWriteAccess
- Updated all read/write operations to use new API

**Learning**: Stay current with language updates and migration guides.

### 5. Multi-Source Oracle Integration

**Challenge**: Integrating multiple price sources (Pragma, Ekubo, MySwap, JediSwap) with fallback logic.

**Impact**: Complex error handling and confidence scoring needed.

**Solution**:
- Implemented primary/fallback pattern with Pragma as primary
- Added staleness checks and deviation limits
- Created confidence scoring system
- Built comprehensive event logging for debugging

**Learning**: Robust oracle systems require multiple data sources and validation.

### 6. Real Token Transfer Implementation

**Challenge**: Moving from mock implementations to real ERC20 transfers with approval flows.

**Impact**: Initial implementations didn't actually move tokens.

**Solution**:
- Implemented full ERC20 dispatcher pattern
- Added approval checks before transfers
- Created proper error handling for insufficient balance/allowance
- Tested with real STRK token on testnet

**Learning**: Production code requires real implementations, not mocks.

### 7. Gas Optimization for Rebalancing

**Challenge**: Rebalancing operations were expensive due to multiple contract calls.

**Impact**: High gas costs would make the protocol uneconomical.

**Solution**:
- Implemented batch operations where possible
- Optimized storage access patterns
- Used events instead of storage for historical data
- Minimized cross-contract calls

**Learning**: Gas optimization is critical for DeFi protocols.

### 8. Wallet Integration Complexity

**Challenge**: StarknetKit documentation was sparse and examples were outdated.

**Impact**: Wallet connection failed with various errors.

**Solution**:
- Studied StarknetKit source code directly
- Implemented exact pattern from official examples
- Created custom hooks for wallet state management
- Added comprehensive error handling

**Learning**: When documentation is lacking, read the source code.
